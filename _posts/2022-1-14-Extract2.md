### 记录一些心动的瞬间（英文）

1.We all live in the past.

We take a  minute to know someone,

one hour to like someone,

and one day to love someone,

but the whole life to forget someone.

——*The Bridge of Madison County（《廊桥遗梦》）*
<br/><br/>

2.We all have our time machine, don't we?

Those that take us back are memories.

And those that carry us forward are dreams.

——*H. G. Wells*
<br/><br/>

3.“You had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, or pray that their sons land on their feet soon enough. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame,don’t snuff it out, don’t be brutal with it. Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we’d want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste!”

——*Call Me by Your Name（《请以你的名字呼唤我》）*
