### 记录一些心动的瞬间（英文）

1.We all live in the past.

We take a  minute to know someone,

one hour to like someone,

and one day to love someone,

but the whole life to forget someone.

——The Bridge of Madison County（《廊桥遗梦》）
<br/><br/>

2.We all have our time machine, don't we?

Those that take us back are memories.

And those that carry us forward are dreams.

——H. G. Wells
<br/><br/>
